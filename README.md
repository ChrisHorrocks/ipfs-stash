IPFS Stash is a small utility for adding files to a private IPFS Cluster. 

Stash initially perform an 'ipfs add' locally to obtain the CID before using 'ipfs-cluster-ctl' to instruct the private IPFS-Cluster to pin & replicate the CID.

It then replaces the original file with a small script, with the same name as the original file, which when executed performs an 'ipfs get' on the CID stored within it before deleting itself.

The original filename, CID and file extension are then saved into an sqlite database in '~/.ipfs-stash/' for future reference. Stash currently doesn't do anything with this data but if you ever lose a script that contains the original file CID you can retrieve it from the database with: sqlite ~/.ipfs-stash/filestore.db "select 1 from files where filename="original-files-name"'

THIS IS AN EXPERRIMENTAL TOOL, NO WARRANTY IS PROVIDED, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

INSTALLATION
'cp stash /usr/local/bin'
'chmod u+x /usr/local/bin/stash'

REMOVAL
'rm /usr/local/bin/stash'
'rm ~/.ipfs-stash'

TODO:
 - opt to disable pinning in local IPFS cluster for archiving files that're no longere required locally
 - opt specify additional tags for database
Â - parameterise pin replicas
 - opt to not replace original file for files that're still needed locally
 - restore preflight sanity checks for local ipfs environment, file type, available disk space in local ipfs repo
